## LESSSONS LEARNT

* 4 hours of coding saves 20 minutes of planning! <br> 
i.e. spend a little bit just planning how you are going to manage state, 
what contents should be in an element/object, then write the code. 
* Same goes for CSS, instead of just adding display: flex everywhere and 
mucking around, just think about the minimal number of changes that need 
to be made to achieve the desired result
