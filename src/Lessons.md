## LESSSONS LEARNT

* 4 hours of coding saves 20 minutes of planning! <br> 
i.e. spend time planning how you are going to manage state,<br> 
what contents should be in an element/object, then write the code. 

* Same goes for CSS, instead of just adding display: flex everywhere and 
mucking around, <br>just think about the minimal number of changes that need 
to be made to achieve the desired result

* If you find your writing spaghetti, literally just take a break and come
back to it. <br> If you don't you are just making more work for yourself!
